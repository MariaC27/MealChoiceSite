Solo Project for FemmeHacks 2021 - This website aims to help users avoid unhealthy snacking and uncertainty by suggesting recipes to make based on user preferences such as type of meal, flavor, and time needed to make the dish. It was developed using javascript, html, and css. The user is guided through a series of menus asking about different options for the meal, and at the end the website suggests a recipe. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
